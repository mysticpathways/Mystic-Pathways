                    <td><p>The Rajdari and Devdari waterfalls are found in the Chandraprabha Wildlife Sanctuary. 
                    The sanctuary was established to conserve Asiatic lions and though their population has dwindled,
                    there are several species of animals and birds that live here. Apart from the animals and birds, 
                    the sanctuary is home to several other attractions, more notably the Rajdari and Devdari waterfalls. 
                    The crystal clear waters, gurgling over the rocks present a breathtaking sight. The scenic, tranquil surroundings lend
                    a sense of mysticism to the experience. People usually come here for a day trip and though there is no accommodation here, 
                    there are several eateries here to serve snacks and drinks.</p>
